            <p>
              I'm a software engineer based in Mayo, Ireland. I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.getfrankli.com" target="_blank">Frankli</a> as a Senior Software Engineer.

              I drink far too much tea and I won't be able to talk to you if there's a dog in the room.

          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>
            There is rarely a moment when I'm not listening to something. I have a wide range of tastes and I'm always on the lookout for new music.
            <br/><br/>
            Here's what I've been listening to lately:

          <h3>Video games</h3>
          <p>
             Playing games is my favourite hobby - I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember. I play most of my games on PC but have owned a variety of consoles over the year due to some games being exclusive to certain platforms.
             <br/><br/>
             I've had my Steam account since 2005 and have amassed a collection of over 1500 games since then. My favourite game is Mirror's Edge.
             <br/><br/>
             The process of designing, developing and releasing a video game fascinates me. I have a collection of video game design books and have tried a small amount of game development myself.
             <br/><br/>
             Myself and my dad worked together to put together a sim-racing setup which we use to play racing games.
