          <p>
            There is rarely a moment when I'm not listening to something. I have a wide range of tastes and I'm always on the lookout for new music.

            If you're interested in seeing what I've been listening to lately, the playlist below is automatically updated with the songs I've been listening to the most.

          <h3>Video games</h3>
          <p>
             Playing games is my favourite hobby - I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember. I play most of my games on PC but have owned a variety of consoles over the year due to some games being exclusive to certain platforms.
             <br/><br/>
             I've had my Steam account since 2005 and have amassed a collection of over 1500 games since then. My favourite game is Mirror's Edge.
             <br/><br/>
             The process of designing, developing and releasing a video game fascinates me. I have a collection of video game design books and have tried a small amount of game development myself.
             <br/><br/>
             Myself and my dad worked together to put together a sim-racing setup which we use to play racing games.
